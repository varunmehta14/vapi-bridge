## üîß **Advanced Configuration**

### **Voice Optimization**
```yaml
# For cost-efficient voice calls
assistant:
  model:
    provider: "google"
    model: "gemini-1.5-flash"  # Faster, cheaper
  system_prompt_template: |
    Keep responses under 3 sentences for voice calls.
    Be direct and actionable.
    Ask follow-up questions if needed.
```

### **Multi-Tool Integration**
```yaml
tools:
  - name: "search_tool"
    # Search functionality
  - name: "analysis_tool"
    # Data analysis
  - name: "notification_tool"
    # Send notifications
  - name: "database_tool"
    # Database operations
```

### **Conditional Logic**
```yaml
system_prompt_template: |
  Based on the user's request:
  - Use search_tool for information queries
  - Use analysis_tool for data processing
  - Use notification_tool for alerts
  - Use database_tool for data storage/retrieval
```

## üìä **Agent Management**

### **Dashboard Integration**
- **Dynamic Status Detection:** System automatically detects active agents
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Live status checks for each agent
- **Service Routing:** Intelligent routing based on configuration
- **Health Checks:** Automatic monitoring of agent endpoints

### **Agent Types Detection**
The system automatically detects:
- **Research Agents:** Tools like `research_topic`, `generate_content`
- **Workflow Agents:** Tools like `triggerFinancialAnalysisWorkflow`
- **Custom Agents:** Any other tool combinations

### **Status Monitoring**
Each agent shows:
- ‚úÖ **Configuration Status:** Valid/Invalid YAML
- üü¢ **Service Status:** Online/Offline
- üîß **Tool Count:** Number of available tools
- üìä **Performance:** Response times and success rates

## üéØ **Best Practices**

### **Voice Optimization**
1. **Keep responses concise** (2-3 sentences for voice)
2. **Use conversational language** that sounds natural
3. **Provide immediate value** before detailed explanations
