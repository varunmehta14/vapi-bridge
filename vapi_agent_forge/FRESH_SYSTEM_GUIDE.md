## ü§ñ Voice Agent Configuration

Once you've configured your services, create voice agents that use them:

```yaml
assistant:
  name: "Your Company Voice Assistant"
  model:
    provider: "openai"
    model: "gpt-4"
    system_prompt_template: |
      You are a voice assistant for Your Company.
      Help users with their requests using our internal systems.
  voice:
    provider: "playht"
    voiceId: "jennifer-playht"
  firstMessage: "Hello! How can I help you today?"

tools:
  - name: "company_research"
    description: "Research topics using our research API"
    parameters:
      type: "object"
      properties:
        query:
          type: "string"
          description: "Research query"
      required: ["query"]
    action:
      method: "POST"
      url: "service://research_api/search"  # Resolves to your configured URL
      json_body:
        query: "{query}"
      response_template: "Research completed: {response.summary}"
```

## üîß Technical Architecture

### Multi-Tenant Design
- **User Isolation**: Each company has isolated service configurations
- **URL Resolution**: `service://service_name/endpoint` resolves to company's URLs
- **Fallback System**: Graceful handling when services aren't configured
- **Scalable**: Supports unlimited companies and services

### API Endpoints
```

  POST /auth/login          - Company signup/login
  GET  /auth/users          - List companies

Service Management:
