# Alternative: Use Environment Variables
# Set these environment variables instead of using this file:
# 
# export RESEARCH_SERVICE_URL="https://research-api.yourcompany.com"
# export CONTENT_SERVICE_URL="https://content-gen.yourcompany.com"
# export WORKFLOW_SERVICE_URL="https://workflow-engine.yourcompany.com"
# export TESSERACT_SERVICE_URL="https://tesseract-api.yourcompany.com"
# export LANGGRAPH_SERVICE_URL="https://langgraph.yourcompany.com"
# export PUBLIC_SERVER_URL="https://vapi-backend.yourcompany.com"
#
# Environment variables take precedence over this file
