# Dynamic Service Setup Guide

This system now uses **completely dynamic service routing** with no hardcoded tool mappings. All tools are routed through user-configured services.

## How It Works

1. **YAML Configuration**: Tools are defined in YAML with their parameters
2. **Service Configuration**: Each tool requires a corresponding service configuration
3. **Dynamic Routing**: The system routes tool calls to the configured service URLs
4. **Response Handling**: Services return responses in their own format, system extracts relevant content

## Setting Up a Service

### Step 1: Configure the Service via API

```bash
# Configure job_analytics service for user ID 1
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/users/1/services" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "service_name": "job_analytics_service",
    "service_url": "http://localhost:8082/jobs/analytics",
    "health_path": "/health",
    "timeout": 30,
    "required": true
  }'
```

### Step 2: YAML Tool Configuration

```yaml
tools:
  - name: "job_analytics"
    description: "Get job statistics and analytics"
    parameters:
      type: "object"
      properties:
        query_type:
          type: "string"
          enum: ["total_jobs", "success_rate", "analytics_summary"]
      required: ["query_type"]
    action:
      method: "POST"
      url: "https://your-webhook-url/webhook/tool-call"
      json_body:
        tool_name: "job_analytics"
        parameters:
          query_type: "{query_type}"
```

## Service Configuration Mapping

The system looks for services using this pattern:
- Tool name: `job_analytics`
- Service key: `job_analytics_service`

## Response Format

Services can return responses in any of these formats:

### Option 1: Standard Fields
```json
{
  "result": "Your response content here",
  "summary": "Alternative response field",
  "content": "Another alternative field"
}
```

### Option 2: Direct String
```json
"Your direct string response"
```

### Option 3: Any JSON
The system will extract the most relevant field or return the full JSON.

## Example Service Configurations

### Research Service
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/users/1/services" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "service_name": "quick_research_service",
    "service_url": "http://localhost:8082/quick-research",
    "timeout": 30
  }'
```

### Content Generation Service
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/users/1/services" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "service_name": "generate_content_service", 
    "service_url": "http://localhost:8082/generate-content",
    "timeout": 45
  }'
```

## Benefits of Dynamic Routing

1. **No Code Changes**: Add new tools without modifying the webhook handler
2. **Flexible Services**: Services can be on different hosts/ports
3. **User-Specific**: Each user can have different service configurations
4. **Easy Testing**: Swap service URLs for testing without code changes
5. **Service Independence**: Each service handles its own parameter mapping and response formatting

## Error Handling

If a service is not configured for a tool, the system returns:
```json
{
  "results": [{
    "toolCallId": "xxx",
    "error": "Service not configured for tool: tool_name"
  }]
}
```

## Migration from Static to Dynamic

1. Remove hardcoded tool mappings âœ…
2. Configure services via API
3. Update YAML configurations to use webhook format
4. Test each tool individually
5. Services handle their own response formatting
